Hi!

there is simple web application, where user can check current currency prices and calculate how much money he will receive in foreign currency. 
Also it's possible to check the average price of the selected currency over the last two weeks. The values are shown in the chart.

To create this project I used:
* Vanilla JS
* NBP Api
* Chart.JS
